This guide walks you through the most effective methods.

## ‚úÖ Option 1: View File Activity in the Document Library

For a quick check:

1. Go to your **SharePoint document library**.
2. Hover over or select the file, then click the **"..." (More options)**.
3. Click **Details**.
4. In the right-hand panel, you‚Äôll see:
   - Who **opened**, **viewed**, or **edited** the file
   - **Date and time** of each activity

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è This shows only **recent** actions and **not the full view history**.

## ‚úÖ Option 2: SharePoint Site Usage Reports

For an overview of how your site and its content are being used:

1. Open your SharePoint site.
2. Click the **‚öôÔ∏è gear icon** > **Site Contents**.
3. Select **Site Usage** from the menu.
4. You'll see:
   - Document and page views
   - Popular content
   - Traffic trends

> üîç These reports are **aggregated** and do **not list individual users**.

## ‚úÖ Option 3: Use Microsoft Purview Audit Logs

For detailed insights on **who viewed or accessed** specific files:

> üîí Requires Microsoft 365 E5 or **Purview Audit (Standard)**.

1. Go to [Microsoft Purview Compliance Center](https://compliance.microsoft.com/).
2. Navigate to **Audit** > **Audit Search**.
3. Filter by activities like:
   - **File viewed**
   - **File accessed**
   - **File downloaded**
4. View:
   - **Username**
   - **Time and date**
   - **Device and IP**

> ‚úÖ This method gives full transparency on file access, ideal for audits or sensitive projects.

## üõ†Ô∏è Option 4: Custom Tracking with Power Automate

Need a lightweight logging solution?

- Create a **Power Automate flow** that records file openings or edits into a SharePoint List.
- Build a **"Read Confirmation"** workflow where users confirm they‚Äôve viewed a file.

This approach gives you full control and flexibility‚Äîwithout premium licensing requirements.
