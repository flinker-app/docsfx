> Note: If you have also created Microsoft security groups the SharePoint user groups can be name identical with the existing Microsoft security groups.

### Option 2: Create Security Groups (optional)

 If you frequently work with the same user groups, it is worthwhile to create security groups to manage users more efficiently. If you operate various projects and you have often times a bunch of same users in a groups you can set up so called security groups for these recurring working (user) groups. This will make your live a little bit easier and save you admin time.

- Go to Microsoft admin > active teams and groups > security groups.
