# 📘 COBie Integration

### Bring structure and clarity to your building data with Flinker’s easy COBie export

## What is COBie?
**COBie** *(Construction-Operations Building information exchange)* is a data format used to deliver building information in a structured spreadsheet format. It’s commonly used in the handover stage to give facility managers all the details they need, like equipment lists, contact info, spaces, and more.<br>

🔹 Output is usually a well-organized Excel file<br>
🔹 Makes it easier to manage buildings after construction<br>
🔹 Compatible with government and commercial BIM requirements<br>

## How Flinker supports COBie
With ***Flinker***, you can export your IFC models into COBie spreadsheets with no fuss and no extra software. Just open your model and export in a few clicks. We make sure the right IFC properties are mapped to the right COBie fields.

> [!TIP]
> Want the best results? Make sure your IFC file is structured properly with standard object types and classifications (like IFCWall, IFCDoor, etc). The cleaner the data, the prettier the COBie sheet
