# IFC Viewer for Microsoft Project (Coming Soon)

Bring BIM data and schedules together. The upcoming IFC Viewer for Microsoft Project connects your IFC models with MS Project timelines, so planning and coordination stay in sync across your project team.

## What you can expect

- Link IFC elements to MS Project tasks for clear 4D planning
- Visualize schedule impacts directly on the model
- Keep task, status, and model data aligned across teams
- Share updates with stakeholders in Microsoft 365

## Why it matters

Projects move faster when models and schedules speak the same language. This integration helps you reduce manual updates, improve transparency, and make coordination meetings more actionable.
