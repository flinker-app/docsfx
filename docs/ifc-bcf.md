Integrate the **BIM Collaboration Format (BCF)** into your SharePoint and Teams workflows to streamline issue tracking and improve project communication.

### What is BCF?

**BCF** (BIM Collaboration Format) is an open standard that lets you share model-based issues across your team. It keeps comments and issue details connected to the 3D model so everyone sees exactly what needs attention, with the full context.

- Works across BIM tools  
- Keeps discussions model-linked  
- Improves clarity and accountability

### Benefits of BCF Integration

- **Seamless Issue Tracking**:  
Manage BCF topics directly inside Microsoft 365.

- **Enhanced Collaboration**:  
Link issues to exact model components and collaborate in real-time with your team inside SharePoint and Teams.

- **Better Workflow Efficiency**:  
Keep everything in one place: models, issues, and updates without switching platforms.

### Automatic Assignment of Views and Filters

BCF integration automatically supports and assigns:
- **Hidden and Selected Items**
- **Clipping Planes**

When you create new topics, these elements are captured automatically, providing additional context without extra effort.

### Practical Examples

- **Saving Filters**: Create a topic in BCF with certain elements hidden or selected to represent a specific issue. This helps team members instantly see the exact condition or scenario you’re describing without manually adjusting their views.

- **Preset Views**: Use clipping planes to clearly highlight structural or mechanical conflicts within the 3D model. Team members can quickly understand and address these issues by simply accessing the topic, seeing the exact viewpoint and configuration you intended.

This simplifies communication and ensures everyone stays aligned with clear visual context.
