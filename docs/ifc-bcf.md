## 📘 BCF Integration

Integrate the **BIM Collaboration Format (BCF)** into your SharePoint and Teams workflows to streamline issue tracking and improve project communication.

### ✅ What is BCF?

**BCF** (BIM Collaboration Format) is an open standard that lets you share model-based issues across your team. It keeps comments and issue details connected to the 3D model so everyone sees exactly what needs attention, with the full context.

🔹 Works across BIM tools  
🔹 Keeps discussions model-linked  
🔹 Improves clarity and accountability

### ✅ Benefits of BCF Integration

&emsp;&emsp;Manage BCF topics directly inside Microsoft 365.

🔹 **Enhanced Collaboration**:  
&emsp;&emsp;Link issues to exact model components and collaborate in real-time with your team inside SharePoint and Teams.

🔹 **Better Workflow Efficiency**:  
&emsp;&emsp;Keep everything in one place: models, issues, and updates without switching platforms.
