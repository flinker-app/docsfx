# Share App Installation

> [!TIP]  
> Why Choose Our SharePoint and Teams Access Control Tool?

> - **Bulk Edits**: Save time by adjusting access settings across teams and folders quickly.  
> - **Secure External Collaboration**: Grant safe access to external users without compromising security.  

> [!Note]
> - 🛡️ **Privacy First: Your Data Stays With You!** No files or data are transferred or uploaded anywhere. All permission management is handled directly within SharePoint, ensuring full privacy and security.
> - 🚨 **App must be installed by a SharePoint administrator!**
