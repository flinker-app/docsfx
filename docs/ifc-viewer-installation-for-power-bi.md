# 3D IFC Viewer Installation for Power BI

> [!TIP]  
> **Why Choose Our IFC Viewer for Power BI?**  
> - **Clear Visualization**: Instantly view and interact with IFC models within Power BI for better insights.  
> - **Seamless Integration**: Easily integrate with your existing Power BI reports and dashboards.  
> - **Enhanced Collaboration**: Share interactive IFC models with your team for improved collaboration.  

## 1. Add IFC Viewer from the Microsoft AppSource

You can add the IFC Viewer to your Power BI environment directly through the AppSource link.

1. Visit the [AppSource link](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/power-bi-visuals/flinkergmbh1644589155747.ifc-viewer).  
2. Click on **Get it now** to proceed with adding the IFC Viewer to your environment.

## 2. Add IFC Viewer to Organizational Visuals (Optional for Admins)

If you want to make the IFC Viewer available to all users in your organization without requiring individual installations, follow these steps to add it to **Organizational visuals**.

1. Go to [Power BI](https://app.powerbi.com) and sign in as an admin. Select **Admin portal** from the left-hand menu.
2. In the Admin portal, click **Organizational visuals** to manage custom visuals.
3. On the **Organizational visuals** page, select **From AppSource**. Search for **IFC Viewer** and click **Add**.

## 3. If Visuals Are Blocked by Administrator Settings

If you encounter a message indicating that the visual is blocked due to administrator settings, there are **two main options** to resolve this:

1. **Request Admin Approval**  
   - Ask your Power BI administrator to enable importing visuals from AppSource or from files in the admin settings.  
   - This permission change will allow you (and other users) to install custom visuals directly.

2. **Admin Adds the Visual to Organizational Visuals**  
   - The administrator can manually add the IFC Viewer (or any other custom visual) to **Organizational visuals**.  
   - Once added, it appears under **From my organization** for all users, bypassing any restrictions on installing custom visuals individually.
