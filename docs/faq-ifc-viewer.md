## What happens if my IFC model takes too long to load?

If your model is taking too long to load, try the following:
1. **Check your internet speed** - A slow connection can delay loading.
2. **Reduce the number of open applications** - Free up memory for better performance.
3. **Ensure your IFC file is optimized** - Large, unoptimized models may take longer to load.

## Does the IFC Viewer support Autodesk Revit or Navisworks files?

The IFC Viewer supports **IFC formats like IFC 2x3, 4, 4x3 and BCF 2.1, 3 file formats**. If you are using **Autodesk Revit or Navisworks**, you can sync your IFC files into **Microsoft SharePoint** and get an **instant live view** both in the Microsoft IFC Viewer in **Teams and SharePoint** for all the project stakeholders.

## How can I make a clip of the model and then make a measurement?

To create a section cut of the model using the Clipping tool and then take a measurement, follow these steps:

1. **Activate the Clipping Tool**
   - Go to the **Clip** menu in the left panel.
   - Click **Activate Clipping** to enable clipping mode.
   - Double-click on a surface to create a clipping plane.
   - Adjust the plane position and orientation as needed to get the desired section view.

2. **Deactivate the Clipping Tool**
   - Once the section is set, **switch to the Measurement tool** by selecting the **Measure** tab in the left panel.
   - This prevents further changes to the clipping plane while measuring.

3. **Take a Measurement**
   - Choose the measurement type (e.g., **Length**).
   - Click on the model to set the measurement points.
   - The measurement should now work without altering the section cut.

By deactivating the Clipping tool before switching to the Measurement tool, you ensure that the section remains unchanged while you take precise measurements.
