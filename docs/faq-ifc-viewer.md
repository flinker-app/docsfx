### Answers

**1. Can the IFC Viewer also be added as a tab in Microsoft Teams?**

Absolutely! We have developed the Microsoft Teams Add-On **"Open IFC Viewer"** so you can add the IFC Viewer as a tab in Microsoft Teams with just one click. However, adding Add-Ons or apps in Microsoft Teams must be allowed by your organization. A quick guide on how to add the IFC Viewer as a new tab can be found here. If your company does not yet allow adding apps from the Microsoft Teams App Store, please contact your IT administrators.


**2. How can I embed the IFC Viewer in Microsoft Teams if my organization does not allow adding apps from the App Store?**

You can insert the IFC Viewer as a URL in Teams. Add a new tab in Microsoft Teams and enter the URL `http://viewer.flinker.app`. Done!


**3. What advantages do I have when I use the official Microsoft Teams app instead of embedding the IFC Viewer as a URL in a Microsoft Teams tab?**

When you embed the IFC Viewer as a URL in a Microsoft Teams tab, you can only load local files, and only you can view these files. However, with the official Open IFC Viewer app for Microsoft Teams, you can load files directly from SharePoint and Teams, and all users in the group can access the models.

A major advantage of the Open IFC Viewer app is that you can store any IFC files, such as an overall coordination model, which is then permanently embedded as a tab in Microsoft Teams. All project participants in Microsoft Teams or on the connected SharePoint page see all changes in the IFC model automatically and in real time with the Open IFC Viewer Add-On. This way, everyone is always up to date, and costly mistakes and confusion are avoided.


**4. Can you set which users can see the IFC model in Teams or SharePoint?**

Yes, you can determine which users or user groups can see the 3D or IFC model in Teams or SharePoint. To do this, you can use Microsoft security groups, SharePoint groups, or the SHARE Add-On. For example, you can restrict access to the IFC model for certain users or groups who are not working on the model or do not need data from it. Additionally, you can set which user groups are allowed to edit the model.
