# Define custom Permissions for Groups and Folders

## Define custom permissions 

### Prerequisites
1. Site Owner or Admin Permissions: You must have sufficient permissions to manage site-level permissions in SharePoint.
2. Existing Groups or Users: Ensure that the SharePoint groups or individual user accounts already exist.
3. Relevant Libraries, Lists, and Folders: Identify which SharePoint assets (libraries, lists, or folders) you want to secure.

### Create and edit custom permissisons
1. **Open Protect App**  
   - Navigate to the desired folder or document library in SharePoint.  
   - Click **Manage Permissions** in the top navigation bar to launch the Protect App.

2. **Add New Permissions**  
   - Click **Add** to assign new permissions to existing SharePoint groups or users.  
   - This automatically breaks inheritance for that folder or library and ensures you can set custom permissions.

3. **Edit or Delete Permissions**  
   - Use the **Edit** or **Delete** options to adjust or remove existing permissions.

> [!Note]
> - **Least Privilege**: Assign only the access necessary (e.g., Read vs. Edit).  
> - **Use Groups**: Grant permissions at the group level rather than per individual.  
> - **Minimize Inheritance Breaks**: Avoid overly complex permission structures.  
> - **Review Regularly**: Audit permissions to keep access levels up to date.

## Use the Permissions Template
This template file can be used to easily duplicate the permission structure and access rights for other SharePoint sites. You will save a lot of time by doing so.
