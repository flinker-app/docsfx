> [!Note]
> **Why Do You Need to Grant File Read Permissions?**
> 
> The **IFC Viewer** requires permission to read the IFC files stored in your **SharePoint** and **Teams**. This is essential for the app to retrieve and display the files directly from these platforms, allowing you to view them without any manual downloads or transfers.
> 
> **Your files are not transferred externally**. The app operates **within the SharePoint and Teams environment**, ensuring that all data remains securely within your organization's ecosystem.
> 
> If you see a message saying that _"This app requires your admin’s approval,"_ it simply means that your organization's security settings require admin approval before third-party apps can access your files. In this case, you will need to contact your IT admin for approval.

## Step 5: Copy Links of IFC Files
Go to the Files tab and copy the links of the IFC files you want to view in the IFC Viewer.

## Step 6: Configure Tab Settings
Return to the tab settings.

![Return to the tab settings](/_media/teams-apps-ifc-viewer-tab-settings-to-connect-with-your-files.png)

Paste the copied IFC file links, and save the settings. Pasting IFC file links from SharePoint or Teams ensures that these files will load automatically whenever the tab is opened.

## IFC Files Load Automatically
