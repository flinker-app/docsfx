# Microsoft Lists and BCF integration

## Track BIM issues like a pro!

Managing BIM issues is now as *easy* as managing a to-do list.
***Flinker*** turns BIM issues *(like BCF topics)* into **clear, actionable tasks inside Microsoft Lists**. No more messy spreadsheets or forgotten tasks, just smooth and organized collaboration.

### Key benefits

**Cross-team tracking**  
Stay on top of project issues across multiple teams and projects - all in *one place*.

**All tasks in one view**  
Use Microsoft Lists to manage BCF issues + other tasks, like:
- ✅ Site visits
- ✅ Approvals
- ✅ Internal to-dos

**Easy to search & filter**  
Quickly *find* any issue or task by:
- ✅ Title
- ✅ Status
- ✅ Assigned person
- ✅ Due date

## How to set up Microsoft Lists sync for your BCF topics

### 1. Create your Microsoft List

To ensure seamless integration, your Microsoft List must include the following **required columns and types**:
* **Guid** *(Text)*
* **Title** *(Text)*


**Optional columns** (add as needed):

* **Description** *(Multiline Text)*
* **Status** *(Choice)*
* **AssignedTo** *(Choice)*
* **TopicType** *(Choice)*
* **Priority** *(Choice)*
* **Stage** *(Choice)*
* **DueDate** *(Date)*
* **CreationDate** *(Date)*
* **CreationAuthor** *(Text)*
* **ModifiedDate** *(Date)*
* **ModifiedAuthor** *(Text)*

If a column is present, the integration will map and update it.

### 2. Insert the Microsoft List URL

- Copy and paste the **Microsoft List URL** (List names with special characters are not supported) into your Teams IFC Viewer app tab settings.
- Copy and paste the **BCF URL** in the settings to ensure all topic data is also saved as a BCF file. You can use an existing BCF file, or you can create a sample BCF file.
