# Multi-file Loading & Coloring Sample

This report template is built to handle real projects with multiple IFC models (discipline splits, versions, or separate buildings) while keeping analysis fast and visual.

Use it as a starting point for quantity takeoff, model validation, and quick exploration of element properties across many files.

## Main advantages

- **Folder loading (multiple files):** Load many IFC files in one go instead of importing them one by one.
- **Subfolder loading:** Keep a clean project structure and optionally include nested folders.
- **Advanced coloring sample:** Use consistent coloring across the 3D model and your charts/tables to make patterns obvious.

## What to try

1. Filter by **Filename** to compare models side-by-side.
2. Switch **Color By** to reveal patterns (types, files, or custom categories).
3. Select elements in the 3D viewer and review their properties to validate data quality.
