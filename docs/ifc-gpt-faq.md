### Answers

#### What can I input in the search field?

You can ask your IFC file anything. Of course your questions should be relevant to the data in the IFC file. You cannot chat with data that is not contained yet in your IFC file - this is understandable.

#### What languages are supported for my IFC GPT prompts/questions?

You can prompt and chat with your IFC file in any major world language. Just as you would do with GPT and other Large language Models (LLMs).

#### Is the Microsoft IFC GPT feature secure?

Absolutely, as any of our privacy-first Microsoft Add-ons. It is as secure as it could be with Microsoft. Azure AI is an enterpise level security technology and is used by the largest organizations worldwide. 

Your data stays with you and your organization! We do not upload your files or data anywhere. This is one of the big benefits when your company works with our Microsoft Add-Ons: There is no need to download your data and upload it again in external software platforms.

All processing is client-side. That means all processing takes place in your SharePoint and MS Teams tenant without sending data to external parties. This ensures full privacy and security.
