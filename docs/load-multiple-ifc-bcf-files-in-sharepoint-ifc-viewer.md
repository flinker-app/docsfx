# How to Load Multiple IFC or BCF Files into the SharePoint IFC Viewer

## Step 1: Open the IFC Viewer Web Part Settings  
Navigate to your SharePoint page where the **IFC Viewer** is embedded. Click on the **settings icon** of the web part to open its configuration.

## Step 2: Paste IFC File URLs  
Copy the SharePoint **file links** of the IFC models you want to load and paste them into the "File Links" field in the IFC Viewer settings.

## Step 3: Get SharePoint Links to IFC Files  
Go to the **Document Library** in your SharePoint site where the IFC files are stored. Right-click on an IFC file, select **"Copy link"**, and copy the URL.

### Alternative: Load All IFC Files from a Folder  
Instead of copying individual links, you can **copy the folder link** where all IFC files are stored. This will automatically load all IFC models in the viewer.

## Step 4: Verify Loaded IFC Files  
Once the links have been added, the IFC models should appear in the viewer. You can see all loaded models in the **Models** section.

## Step 5: Save and Publish Changes  
Finally, click **"Save as Draft"** and **"Republish"** the page to apply the changes. This ensures the IFC Viewer is updated with the new models.
