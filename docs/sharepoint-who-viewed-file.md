# 📘 How to See Who Viewed Files in SharePoint

### Track document access across your SharePoint and Teams environments

Knowing who has viewed or accessed files helps you stay compliant, improve collaboration, and ensure accountability. SharePoint offers several built-in tools—plus deeper integrations with Microsoft 365—to give you visibility into file activity.

---

## ✅ Check File Activity in the Document Library

For quick visibility on recent interactions:

1. Go to your **SharePoint document library**
2. Hover over the file and click **“...” (More options)**
3. Select **Details**
4. On the right panel, you’ll see:
   - Who **opened**, **viewed**, or **edited** the file
   - The **time and date** of each action

> [!TIP]  
> This panel only shows **recent** actions and doesn’t include the full view history.

---

## 📊 Use Site Usage Reports for Trends

To understand how your SharePoint content is used at a higher level:

1. Navigate to your **SharePoint site**
2. Click the **⚙️ gear icon** > **Site contents**
3. Open **Site usage**
4. You’ll get insights into:
   - **Page and file views**
   - **Popular content**
   - **Traffic patterns over time**

> [!NOTE]  
> These reports are **aggregated** and do **not** include individual usernames.

## 🔐 Access Audit Logs via Microsoft Purview

Need to know exactly *who* opened or viewed a file? Use the built-in audit logs:

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This requires **Microsoft 365 E5** or **Purview Audit (Standard)**.

1. Go to [Microsoft Purview Compliance Center](https://compliance.microsoft.com/)
2. Open the **Audit** section
3. Run a search for activities like:
   - **Viewed file**
   - **Accessed file**
   - **Downloaded file**
4. Filter by user, file name, date, and more

You’ll see:
- **Username**
- **Date & time**
- **IP address / device used**

## ⚙️ Build Custom Logs with Power Automate

Want a lightweight, no-code solution?

- Use **Power Automate** to log every file open or edit in a SharePoint List
- Or create a **Read Confirmation Flow**, where users confirm when they’ve accessed a file

This gives you full control—without requiring premium Microsoft 365 plans.
